    <h1>What is the Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage?</h1>
    <p>While localStorage and sessionStorage are similar, localStorage's data never expires while sessionStorage's data is deleted when the page session closes. A unique page session is created and assigned <br>to a specific tab in the browser each time a document is loaded there.<br>localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same. Both have the following rules:

       <li>They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.</li>
       <li>   The values stored may only be strings.</li>
       <li>They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.</li>
       <br>
       
    
       
       The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.
        localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
        sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.</p>
        
        <h1>What is the Difference Between Global scope and block scope?</h1>
        
        <p>Global Scope
            Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
            
            Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
            
            Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
            
            They all have Global Scope:</p>
        <p>Block Scope is the area within if, switch conditions and for, while loops. In ES6, const and let are the keywords that are used to define variables for a block scope accessibility,<br> which means that those variables exist only within the corresponding block.

        <h1>How event loop works in javascript</h1>
        <p>
            The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.



The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.



The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.<br>

Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.

An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation back in for processing.

 The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate threads.

The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is processed.

        <h1>8 ways to get undefined</h1>
        <li>Variable that is not initialized will give undefine</li>
        <li>function with no return.</li>
        <li>parameter that is not passed will be undefined</li>
        <li> If return has nothing on the right side will return side will return undefined </li>
        <li> property that  does not exits on an object will give you undefined  </li>
        <li>accessing array element outside of the index range will give you undefined</li>
        <li>Deleting on element inside an array </li>
        <li>set a value directlt to undefined </li>
