    <h1>What is the Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage?</h1>
    <p>While localStorage and sessionStorage are similar, localStorage's data never expires while sessionStorage's data is deleted when the page session closes. A unique page session is created and assigned to a specific tab in the browser each time a document is loaded there.</p>
